**Dependencies:**

-   Bcrypt - A library to help you hash passwords.

-   Dotenv - Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into [process.env](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#process_process_env). This will help save confidential variables that we do not want to be made public.
    
-   Express - Web framework for node
    
-   Express-session - This will help save user sessions on server side.
    
-   Mysql2 - This will allow MySQL client to communicate with Node.js

###  Setup the app to locally run it

First, MySQL Database Setup

In order to run this application, you should have the MySQL database already set up on your machine. If you don't currently have it, visit the  [MySQL installation page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/installing.html)  to install latest version. Once you have MySQL installed, you will be able to create the **Wellnest** database.. You will be running this code inside your MySQL client.

	-- Drops the wellnest if it exists currently --

	DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS wellnest;

	-- Creates the "wellnest" database --

	CREATE DATABASE wellnest;

Second, Create a file named ".env" and make sure you have the following code inside it (without the ' ' :
```
SQL_PWD = 'YOUR-SQL-PASSWORD'
```
Third, we are assuming you have the node.js installed. If you don't have it, visit [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/) on how to install it. It's important because you will be able to install the dependencies for npm. Type "npm i" to install all the dependencies.

You should be all set up. Simply type "node server.js" and visit the port indicated in the terminal.
